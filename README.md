# Doodle-Jump

This game is written in python 2.7 and requires pygame.

The game is started from doodle_jump.py

You control a character whose goal is to get as high of an elevation as possible. You do this by jumping on the platforms and avoid falling below the bottom of the window. The game ends when the character touches the bottom of the window.

The game is played using arrow keys or 'a'/'d'.

The random#.txt control where the platforms are drawn and are rewritten each time the game is run, if you would like to replay the exact same platfor mlayout as the previous game, run doodle_jump.pyc instead of doodle_jump.py
